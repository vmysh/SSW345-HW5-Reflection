**REFLECTION**

**Design**

1. The most helpful about thinking about design methods was brainstorming possible use-case scenarios and then focusing on the main ones and writing them out in detail. I think that writing out the use cases helps better understant where to start the project, which is usually the hardest part for me. I think it is important to include enough detail in the use-cases so that it would be easy to divide them into stories/tasks, but not so detailed that it limits the thinking about the overall project and makes the team ignore some features that would have been beneficial to include.

2. For me, the most difficult part was making the sequence flow diagrams. I think this is because I still haven't had enought practice to really understand them. So I never refered to the sequence diagram when working on the actual project. For my next project I would either omit the sequence flow diagram, or I would get more practice so that it is useful for me when working on the project.

3. For a future project, I would want to try writing out the use-case scenarios and making an architecture design model. Even if I don't follow these outlines to a tee, they are still helpful in making the project work more organized. For example, for this project I ended up using a different cryptocurrency API than the one mentioned in the architecture design model, but the overall design did not change.

**Implementation**

1. The most helpful part for me was being able to first test the code on my local copy and fix any bugs, and then commit a working piece of code to the main remote repository. Every commit felt like crossing something out of the to do list because I knew that I was commiting working code.

2. The most difficult part was implementing the use of different branched to work on the project. This was my first time working with more than one branch, so I am still pretty new to the concept. In the end, I stopped using the development branch and just committed everything to main (I know this is bad practice). But overall, this did not impact the flow of the project because I was making most (if not all) of the commits. I think that this summer I'm going to get more comfortable working with branches on GitHub so that I could implement this practice in my next team project. 

3. I would definitely use Git and GitHub on my next project. I will also continue using certain practices like committing often and writing meaningful commit messages, as this makes the workflow more organized.  

**Process**

1. This was the first time I learned what a Kanban board was, and I thought that is was very helpful. I like having a visual representation of things that need to be done/things that are completed. By looking at the Kanban board, I could crearly see what needed to be done next. Also, the use of labels was pretty neat. Although rating the tasks based on complexity (1,3,5,8) and importance (important or optional) was arbitrary, it still helped to stay on track and possibly increase the speed of development. 

2. First, my team did not do any code reviews, so I cannot say that was helpful. Second, since this was my first time using a Kanban board, I feel like I did not use it to its full potential. For instance, I did not implement automatization of issues to be moved to the correct column of the board when an issues was closed, so I had to do that manually, which created unnecessary friction. Also, it was difficult making sure that the developers assigned to the tasks/issues were actually the ones working on that issue. You have to constanly make sure that all team members are aware of the Kanban board and the tasks assigned to them. Next time, I would definitely make use of the automatization feature of the Kanban board.

3. On my next project, I would use issues and labels to help divide the workload between team members. I may try to use the Kanban board again, but I will first make sure that all team members are ok with using it.

**Ovreall**

I think that creating detailed use-case scenarios and using issues/Kanban board go hand-in-had to help organize the workflow of a project. On the other hand, some practices/processes did not do much to increase the productivity and workflow, like making sequence diagrams, creating different development brances, or assigning deveopers to issues on a Kanban board. I think maintaining consistent commit practices (small one-purpose commits, meaningful messages, committing often) would be helpful when working with different branches - something I want to do on my next team project.
